# K-Nearest Neighbours on Zoo Dataset 🦁🦓

- Analyzed the Zoo dataset using visualizations to understand feature patterns and class distribution.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and checking for outliers to ensure quality input for the model.
- Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets for fair evaluation.
- Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm using scikit-learn.
- Experimented with different values of K and used the Euclidean distance metric for classification.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
- Visualized decision boundaries to see how the KNN model distinguishes between animal types.

> Working on the Zoo dataset was fun and insightful — turning biological traits into a classification problem made machine learning feel both practical and exciting!
